This is a prompt generator that uses templates to randomly generate prompt permutations and, optionally, make them into invoke-readable input files.

Create a folder inside your invokeai/ directory called "gen", or whatever you prefer, and place these files in it.
- template_gen.py
- example_template.yaml

Now load the invoke developer console:

    C:\[path-to]\invokeai>invoke.bat
 
    Do you want to generate images using the
    1. command-line interface
    2. browser-based UI
    3. run textual inversion training
    4. merge models (diffusers type only)
    5. download and install models
    6. change InvokeAI startup options
    7. re-run the configure script to fix a broken install
    8. open the developer console <-- choose 8 to enter the virtual environment
    9. update InvokeAI
    10. command-line help
    Q - quit
    Please enter 1-10, Q: [2] 8

    (.venv) C:\[path-to]\invokeai>cd gen
    (.venv) C:\[path-to]\invokeai\gen>python -i templ-gen.py

    >>> loadTemplate("example_template.yaml")

    >>> printTemplate("example_output.yaml", makePrompts(10), models=["526mixV14_v14", "verisimilitude"])

Now, from a new terminal, go to the path containing the invoke executable (invokeai\.venv\Scripts on Windows) and run invoke specifying the path to the template thus created. The above call to printTemplate assumes you have the models 526mixV14_v14 and verisimilitude installed. Change as needed!
